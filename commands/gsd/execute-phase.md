<objective>
Execute all plans in a phase using wave-based parallel execution.

Orchestrator stays lean: discover plans, analyze dependencies, group into waves, spawn subagents, collect results. Each subagent loads the full execute-plan context and handles its own plan.

Optional wave filter:
- `--wave N` executes only Wave `N` for pacing, quota management, or staged rollout
- phase verification/completion still only happens when no incomplete plans remain after the selected wave finishes

Flag handling rule:
- The optional flags documented below are available behaviors, not implied active behaviors
- A flag is active only when its literal token appears in `$ARGUMENTS`
- If a documented flag is absent from `$ARGUMENTS`, treat it as inactive

Context budget: ~15% orchestrator, 100% fresh per subagent.
</objective>

<context>
Phase: $ARGUMENTS

**Available optional flags (documentation only — not automatically active):**
- `--wave N` — Execute only Wave `N` in the phase. Use when you want to pace execution or stay inside usage limits.
- `--gaps-only` — Execute only gap closure plans (plans with `gap_closure: true` in frontmatter). Use after verify-work creates fix plans.
- `--interactive` — Execute plans sequentially inline (no subagents) with user checkpoints between tasks. Lower token usage, pair-programming style. Best for small phases, bug fixes, and verification gaps.

**Active flags must be derived from `$ARGUMENTS`:**
- `--wave N` is active only if the literal `--wave` token is present in `$ARGUMENTS`
- `--gaps-only` is active only if the literal `--gaps-only` token is present in `$ARGUMENTS`
- `--interactive` is active only if the literal `--interactive` token is present in `$ARGUMENTS`
- If none of these tokens appear, run the standard full-phase execution flow with no flag-specific filtering
- Do not infer that a flag is active just because it is documented in this prompt
</context>

<process>
Extract the phase number from $ARGUMENTS. Then call the gsd-guardian MCP tool `gsd_workflow` with:
- workflow: "execute-phase"
- args: '{"phase": "<phase_number>"}'

The server returns stages one at a time. For each stage:
1. Read the stage `instructions` and execute them using the tools listed in `hints`
2. When instructions say "Call the gsd-guardian MCP tool 'X'", use `call_mcp_tool(ServerName: "gsd-guardian", ToolName: "X", ...)`
3. When instructions reference agent tools (view_file, run_command, write_to_file, invoke_subagent), use those directly
4. When instructions say to ask the user, use ask_question
5. Collect all `required_outputs` specified in the stage
6. Call `gsd_workflow` again with the `session_id` and your `stage_outputs` as a JSON string

Repeat until the server returns `nextStageNeeded: false`.

**CRITICAL:** You MUST keep calling gsd_workflow until completion. Do not stop mid-workflow. Each stage depends on the previous stage's outputs. If a stage fails, report the error in stage_outputs and let the server decide the next action.
