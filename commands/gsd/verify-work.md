<objective>
Validate built features through conversational testing with persistent state.

Purpose: Confirm what Claude built actually works from user's perspective. One test at a time, plain text responses, no interrogation. When issues are found, automatically diagnose, plan fixes, and prepare for execution.

Output: {phase_num}-UAT.md tracking all test results. If issues found: diagnosed gaps, verified fix plans ready for /gsd:execute-phase
</objective>

<context>
Phase: $ARGUMENTS (optional)
- If provided: Test specific phase (e.g., "4")
- If not provided: Check for active sessions or prompt for phase

Context files are resolved inside the workflow (`init verify-work`) and delegated via `<files_to_read>` blocks.
</context>

<process>
Extract the phase number from $ARGUMENTS. Then call the gsd-guardian MCP tool `gsd_workflow` with:
- workflow: "verify-work"
- args: '{"phase": "<phase_number>"}'

The server returns stages one at a time. For each stage:
1. Read the stage `instructions` and execute them using the tools listed in `hints`
2. When instructions say "Call the gsd-guardian MCP tool 'X'", use `call_mcp_tool(ServerName: "gsd-guardian", ToolName: "X", ...)`
3. When instructions reference agent tools (view_file, run_command, write_to_file, invoke_subagent), use those directly
4. When instructions say to ask the user, use ask_question
5. Collect all `required_outputs` specified in the stage
6. Call `gsd_workflow` again with the `session_id` and your `stage_outputs` as a JSON string

Repeat until the server returns `nextStageNeeded: false`.

**CRITICAL:** You MUST keep calling gsd_workflow until completion. Do not stop mid-workflow. Each stage depends on the previous stage's outputs. If a stage fails, report the error in stage_outputs and let the server decide the next action.
