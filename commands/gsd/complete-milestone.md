<objective>
Mark milestone {{version}} complete, archive to milestones/, and update ROADMAP.md and REQUIREMENTS.md.

Purpose: Create historical record of shipped version, archive milestone artifacts (roadmap + requirements), and prepare for next milestone.
Output: Milestone archived (roadmap + requirements), PROJECT.md evolved, git tagged.
</objective>

<context>
**Project files:**
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `.planning/STATE.md`
- `.planning/PROJECT.md`

**User input:**

- Version: {{version}} (e.g., "1.0", "1.1", "2.0")
  </context>

<process>
Call the gsd-guardian MCP tool `gsd_workflow` with:
- workflow: "complete-milestone"
- args: '{}'

The server returns stages one at a time. For each stage:
1. Read the stage `instructions` and execute them using the tools listed in `hints`
2. When instructions say "Call the gsd-guardian MCP tool 'X'", use `call_mcp_tool(ServerName: "gsd-guardian", ToolName: "X", ...)`
3. When instructions reference agent tools (view_file, run_command, write_to_file, invoke_subagent), use those directly
4. When instructions say to ask the user, use ask_question
5. Collect all `required_outputs` specified in the stage
6. Call `gsd_workflow` again with the `session_id` and your `stage_outputs` as a JSON string

Repeat until the server returns `nextStageNeeded: false`.

**CRITICAL:** You MUST keep calling gsd_workflow until completion. Do not stop mid-workflow. Each stage depends on the previous stage's outputs. If a stage fails, report the error in stage_outputs and let the server decide the next action.
